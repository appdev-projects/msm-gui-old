# MSM GUI

It's time to add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) on top of our APIs.

First, read through the code that we're starting with. A good sequence to read through is always:

 - `config/routes.rb` — get a sense of the API (the surface) of the application
 - `app/models/` — get a sense of the tables and business logic (the heart) of the application
 - `app/controllers` — see how they tie together

Think of at least one question to ask.
